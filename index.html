    <h2> <center> Why You Should Be Composting </center> </h2>
    First of all, a compost is made up of dirt, worms, and compostable materials such as fruit scraps, newspaper<br>
    strips, and coffee grinds. The worms work as decomposers to break the materials down into dirt.<br><br><br>
    When you throw something into the trash, you're doing more damage to Earth than you think. That one piece of trash<br>
    is thrown into one of the 245 million landfills in the world.  Not only are the ongoing piles of trash taking up land, but<br>
    they are also ruining our Earth's environment. Through harmful toxins and gases, the world's air and soil are becoming<br>
    highly polluted. About 24% of trash in those landfills could have been composted.<br><br><br>
  
    Composting just even at your own home spares the creation of even more landfill pollution. By doing your simple part with<br>
    home composting, you can help make the earth a cleaner place. Instead of your "trash" sitting in a harmful landfill, it can be in a<br>
    compost at your house where it can be mixed around in a beneficial way. The landfill environment produces methane gas<br>
    due to stationary waste, whereas composts do not.
