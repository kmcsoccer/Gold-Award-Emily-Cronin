  <li> Acidic foods hurt worms; don't put them in compost. Examples include the peels and insides of lemons, oranges, limes, and onions.</li><br>
  <li> Milk and meat products attract unwanted pests; don't put them in compost. Examples include chicken, salmon, bacon, butter, and cheese.</li><br>
  <li> Newspaper strips and paper egg cartons can be added to a compost, but they cannot have colored print on them.</li><br>
  <li> Clothing made with biodegrable materials like cotton, silk, and wool don't include unnatural dye and can be included in compost bins. 
    Clothing made with synthetic materials like polyester and spandex should never be used.</li><br>
  <li> Plastic items take too long to degrade and should never be put in a compost bin. Example incude food wrappers, plastic bags, and plastic water bottles.</li><br>
  <li> Greasy foods such as chips, fries, and sausage should never be put in a compost.</li><br>
  <li> Natural cotton balls can be added into compost bins, but cannot be soaked with any substances because oils attract unwanted pests.</li><br>
  <li> Fruit pits from magos, avocados, peaches, plums, etc. can be used in a compost bin.</li><br>
  <li> Tea leaves and coffee grinds are welcome in compost bins, but since tea and coffe bags contain synthetic materials, those items are not welcome.</li><br>
  <li> Fallen leaves, pine needles, twigs, newspaper strips, plastic egg cartons and dryer lint are just a few items called "brown material." Brown material is dry or woody plant based material
